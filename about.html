                                <p>Memento is a company that was created in the year 2015 when the current partners found a gap
                                    in the photography industry. The gap came about from the fact that clients looking for
                                    photographers found a hard time finding their dream photographer. Well,this is where
                                    Memento jumped in to help. We came up with a company that connects clients to their dream
                                    photographer for any single event available and the price rates for each photographer for
                                    each event to save time when looking for photographers and discussing and bargaining prices.</p>
                                <p>We believe that our company is for every single one of you. Do not worry about the prices
                                    because, let's be honest, by the end of the day we want satisafactory work but the money
                                    also has it's role to play hence we have the best photographers in the country offering
                                    great services at affordable and various prices.</p>
                                <p>We as the memento fraternity try everyday to live by our mission which is we capture
                                    your moments from today as we create memories for a lifetime.
